              This is the most straightforward way of handling a loading state
              and along with <a href="#loading-content">loading content</a> the
              most common one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s say that in front of you is a login form and you’ve just
              typed in your credentials. Now you may want to submit your
              credentials to authenticate yourself and access your private
              content. After clicking the submit button a few things can happen.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The server request performs flawlessly and you get a desired
                response
              </li>
              <li>The request either errors or times out</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Either way, a certain amount of time passes by during which we are
              unsure of the outcome of the operation.
            </p>
            <p>
              First we ought to communicate to the user that the operation has
              started and update the user as much as possible about the progress
              of the operation. For their own benefit, you may also want to
              disallow the user to initiate any new operation of the same kind
              until the first one has completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              An easy way to accomplish that objective is to disabled the submit
              button and/or set the buttons children and cursor to loading,
              until one of the beforementioned outcomes meet the users request.
            </p>
            <h2 id="loading-content">Loading Content</h2>
            <p>
              The modern trend of handling content loading is to display a
              discretely shimmer shape ( usually a rectangle or a circle ),
              which resembles the shape of the content which shall be loaded
              form the server.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is good for a number of reasons. Firstly, it sets the users
              expextations for what to expect after the loading has finished (
              it is much more descriptive than a simple loading spinner ).
              Secondly, the loaded content doesn’t appear out of the blue, but
              instead gently emerges from the shimmering shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the question is how to create those shimmering shapes for the
              content you need to load. Considering the countless shapes data
              can have an all of the different arrangements finding an easy way
              to generate loading shapes seems like a difficult task.
            </p>
            <p>
              The obvious way to do it would be to create the loading shapes ad
              hoc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since you’re a developer you probably have it in you to contantly
              try to improve things and find easier way of accomplish monotonous
              tasks and this seems like the right opportunity to put your
              creativity and smarts to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following is one simple <code>one size fits all</code> higher
              order component which you may use to display appropriately sized
              <strong>loading shapes</strong> regardless of the shape of the
              content. This technique isn’t perfect however since the
              <code>HOC</code> requires you to have a know what a tipical
              instance of your content is going to be. For example a typical
              female name might be <code>Jane</code>.

            <h2 id="lazy-loading-pages">Lazy Loading Pages</h2>
            <p>
              The third type is least common of the 3, but important
              nevertheless. At a certain point, when one of your pages grows
              significantly, or when a certain page is using a large third party
              dependency, you might want to lazy load that page to decrease time
              to
              <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-meaningful-paint"
                >first meaningful paint</a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive"
                >time to interactive</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the <strong>page loading skeleton</strong> will be included
              in your base bundle and the page itself will be loaded lazily -
              the page loading skeleton will be a completely separate entity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually you would create a handcrafted version of a page but will
              all major content containers replaced with
              <strong>shimmering boxes</strong>. This would require you to
              meticulously replicate the layout of the original page and any
              change that you make to the original page shall require
              adjustments of the <strong>page loading skeleton</strong>. This is
              a painstaking process, but the good news is - there is an easier
              way.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can separate the flash from the bone by extracting layout
              components into a <strong>page skeleton</strong> component which
              does not care too much about the gems you insert into its slots
              since it only knows how to position those elements. The you would
              use the <strong>page skeleton</strong> as the basis for creating
              the page component itself as well as the
              <strong>page loading skeleton</strong> keeping the layout in sync
              between the two.
